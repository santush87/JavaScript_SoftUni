<h2>1.	Fruit</h2>
<p>Write a function that calculates how much money you need to buy fruit. You will receive a string for the type of fruit you want to buy, a number for weight in grams, and another number for the price per kilogram. </p>
<p>Print the following text on the console:  </p>
<p>`I need ${money} to buy {weight} kilograms {fruit}.`</p>
<p>Print the weight and the money rounded to two decimal places.</p>
<p>The input comes as three arguments passed to your function.</p>
<p>The output should be printed on the console.</p>

<h2>4.	Time to Walk</h2>
<p>Write a function that calculates how long it takes a student to get to university. 
The function takes three numbers:
</p>
<p>•	The first is the number of steps the student takes from their home to the university</p>
<p>•	Тhe second number is the length of the student's footprint in meters</p>
<p>•	Тhe third number is the student speed in km/h</p>
<p>Every 500 meters the student rests and takes a 1-minute break.</p>
<p>Calculate how long the student walks from home to university and print on the console the result in the following format: `hours:minutes:seconds`.</p>
<p>The input comes as three numbers.</p>
<p>The output should be printed on the console.</p>

<h2>5.	Road Radar</h2>
<p>Write a function that determines whether a driver is within the speed limit. You will receive the speed and the area. Each area has a different limit: </p>
<p>•	On the motorway, the limit is 130 km/h</p>
<p>•	On the interstate, the limit is 90 km/h</p>
<p>•	In the city, the limit is 50 km/h </p>
<p>•	Within a residential area, the limit is 20 km/h</p>
<p>If the driver is within the limits, there should be a printed speed and the speed limit. </p>
<p>                `Driving {speed} km/h in a {speed limit} zone`</p>
<p>If the driver is over the limit, however, your function should print the severity of the infraction and the difference in speeds. </p>
<p>`The speed is {difference} km/h faster than the allowed speed of {speed limit} - {status}`</p>
<p>For speeding up to 20 km/h over the limit, the status should be speeding.</p>
<p>For speeding up to 40 km/h over the limit, the status should be excessive speeding.</p>
<p>For anything else, status should be reckless driving.</p>
<p>The input comes as 2 string parameters. The first element is the current speed (number), the second element is the area.</p>
<p>The output should be printed on the console.</p>

<h2>6.	Cooking by Numbers</h2>
<p>Write a program that receives 6 parameters which are a number and a list of five operations. Perform the operations sequentially by starting with the input number and using the result of every operation as a starting point for the next one. Print the result of every operation in order. The operations can be one of the following:</p>
<p>•	chop - divide the number by two</p>
<p>•	dice - square root of a number</p>
<p>•	spice - add 1 to the number</p>
<p>•	bake - multiply number by 3</p>
<p>•	fillet - subtract 20% from the number</p>
<p>The input comes as 6 string elements. The first element is the starting point and must be parsed to a number. The remaining 5 elements are the names of the operations to be performed.</p>
<p>The output should be printed on the console.</p>
